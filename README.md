# Learning Programming

Dedicated to documenting my journey of learning* programming languages, this repo incorporates long "tester" files 
that are heavily commented. Note to curious readers, some of the programs aren't functional until comment blocks 
are adjusted. 






*This showcases a very small portion of my "learning" and really represents more of a cursory undertanding of the syntactical tenets of the language in question. The "proof is in the pudding" per se
so I'd recommend the onlooker to view my projects as well to get a true grasp of my competency.
